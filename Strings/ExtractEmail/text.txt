    are a widely distributed and diverse parvorder of carnivorous marine mammals. They include 15
	 species from the families Balaenidae (including right whales), Cetotheriidae (the pygmy right whale),
	  Eschrichtiidae (the gray whale), and Balaenopteridae (the rorquals, includin family@aubg.bg g the
	   blue whale, the largest animal on earth). Cetaceans were thought to have descended from the extinct 
	   mesonychids, but molecular evidence supports their descent from even-toed ungulates. Baleen whales
	    split from toothed whales around 34 million years ago. The meat, blubber, baleen, and oil of baleen
		 whales have traditionally been used by the indigenous peoples of the Arctic. Once relentlessly hunted

		  international law, but Japan, Norway and Iceland continue to allow whaling for various purposes.
		   Baleen whales also face threats from marine pollution, ocean acidification, coll dds@aubg.bg

			 communication. They have rarely survived for long in captivity. (Full article...)
